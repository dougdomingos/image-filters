# Image Filters

A Go library that offers a wide collection of image filters (e.g. Grayscale, Mirroring,
Edge Detection), implemented using various image processing techniques.

The main objective of this project is to improve my skills with Go and its
concurrency model. Throughout its development, there are other goals I intend to
achieve, which are:

- Benchmarking both serial and concurrent implementations of
  computationally expensive tasks

- Expanding my knowledge on image processing techniques and algorithms, without
  relying on third-party libraries

- Investigating the impact of different partition methods on the
  performance of matrix-based operations
