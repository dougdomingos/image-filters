// Pacakge gaussian_blur implements the gaussian blur filter.
// 
// The Gaussian blur filter applies a smoothing effect to an image by averaging
// neighboring pixels with a Gaussian function, which reduces image noise and
// detail. The kernel used in color calculations is automatically generated
// based on a predefined kernel size and standard deviation of the neighbors
// (represented by sigma, or "Ïƒ").

// GaussianBlurPipeline defines the Gaussian blur filter pipeline. As this
// filter does not require any preprocessing pipeline, the preprocess step is
// not declared.
